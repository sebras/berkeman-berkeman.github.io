The Expertmaker Accelerator is a well-proven data processing framework
that provides fast data access, parallel execution, and automatic
organization of source code, input data, and results. It can be used
for daily data analysis tasks as well as operating as a live
recommendation system in production with hundreds of thousands of
large data files and many CPUs.

The Accelerator was developed by the Swedish AI company Expertmaker.
The first project using the Accelerator was run in 2012, and since
then it has been the core tool in a number of studies and live
production recommendation systems. In 2016, Expertmaker was acquired
by eBay.

The Accelerator is released as open source by eBay under the Apache
V2.0 license, and is updated continuously.
